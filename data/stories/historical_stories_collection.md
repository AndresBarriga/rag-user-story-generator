## Bug Report - API Connection Timeout [RESOLVED]

**Bug ID:** TNG4-11887  
**Title:** Oracle Simphony API Connection Timeout During Peak Hours  
**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Resolution Date:** July 5, 2025  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Affected Systems:** Oracle Integration, Order Processing

### Bug Description
**Issue:** During peak restaurant hours (6-8 PM), the Oracle Simphony API integration experiences frequent connection timeouts, causing orders to fail and requiring manual intervention.

**Reporter:** James Thompson (QA Lead)  
**Reported Date:** June 28, 2025  
**Environment:** Production  
**Affected Restaurants:** 3 locations with high table count (>30 tables)

### Symptoms Observed
**User Experience:**
- Customers receive "Order Processing Failed" errors
- Orders stuck in "Pending" status for 5+ minutes
- Kitchen display system shows incomplete order information
- Staff required to manually re-enter orders into Oracle

**System Behavior:**
- API response times exceed 30 seconds
- Connection pool exhaustion errors
- Increased error rates during 6-8 PM window
- Database connection spikes correlating with timeouts

### Technical Investigation

**Root Cause Analysis:**
```javascript
// Original problematic code
const oracleAPI = {
  timeout: 10000, // 10 seconds - too aggressive
  maxConnections: 5, // Too low for peak load
  retryAttempts: 1, // Insufficient retry logic
  
  async createOrder(orderData) {
    // No connection pooling
    const connection = await oracle.getConnection();
    try {
      return await connection.execute(orderData);
    } finally {
      await connection.close(); // Creating/destroying connections frequently
    }
  }
};
```

**Performance Metrics During Peak Hours:**
- Average API response time: 25 seconds
- Connection pool utilization: 100%
- Error rate: 15% (Target: < 1%)
- Orders requiring manual intervention: 47 per hour

**Network Analysis:**
- Oracle server response time: 8-12 seconds during peak
- Database query execution time: 3-5 seconds
- Network latency: 100-200ms
- Connection establishment time: 2-3 seconds

### Resolution Implementation

**Solution 1: Connection Pool Optimization**
```javascript
// Improved connection pooling
const oraclePool = {
  poolMin: 5,
  poolMax: 20,
  poolIncrement: 2,
  poolTimeout: 60,
  queueTimeout: 30000,
  stmtCacheSize: 30
};

const connectionPool = await oracle.createPool(oraclePool);

// Reuse connections instead of creating new ones
const executeQuery = async (query, params) => {
  const connection = await connectionPool.getConnection();
  try {
    return await connection.execute(query, params);
  } finally {
    await connection.close(); // Returns to pool
  }
};
```

**Solution 2: Timeout Configuration**
```javascript
// Optimized timeout settings
const apiConfig = {
  timeout: 45000, // Increased to 45 seconds
  retryAttempts: 3, // Increased retry attempts
  retryDelay: 2000, // 2 second delay between retries
  circuitBreaker: {
    failureThreshold: 5,
    resetTimeout: 30000
  }
};
```

**Solution 3: Asynchronous Processing**
```javascript
// Order queue implementation
const orderQueue = new Queue('oracle-orders', {
  defaultJobOptions: {
    attempts: 3,
    backoff: 'exponential',
    delay: 1000
  }
});

// Process orders asynchronously
const processOrder = async (orderData) => {
  try {
    const result = await oracleAPI.createOrder(orderData);
    await notifyKitchen(result);
    await updateCustomerStatus(orderData.orderId, 'confirmed');
  } catch (error) {
    await handleOrderFailure(orderData, error);
  }
};
```

### Testing and Validation
