## Bug Report - Payment Processing Failure During Peak Booking [RESOLVED]

**Bug ID:** PPE4-11150  
**Title:** PayPal Payment Processing Timeout During Weekend Peak Booking Hours  
**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Resolution Date:** July 18, 2025  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Affected Systems:** PayPal Integration, Booking Confirmation, Guest Communication

### Bug Description

**Issue:** During weekend peak booking hours (Friday 6 PM - Sunday 11 PM), PayPal payment processing experiences frequent timeouts, causing booking confirmations to fail and leaving guests without access codes or check-in instructions.

**Reporter:** Michael Chen (Customer Success Manager)  
**Reported Date:** July 12, 2025  
**Environment:** Production  
**Affected Properties:** All properties with PayPal integration (85+ properties)

### Symptoms Observed

**Guest Experience:**

- Payment successful but booking confirmation email never sent
- Smart lock access codes not generated
- Guests arriving without check-in instructions
- Customer service calls increased by 300% during weekends

**System Behavior:**

- PayPal webhook delivery delays of 15-45 minutes
- Database booking status stuck in "payment_pending"
- Guest communication system not triggered
- Smart home preparation workflow fails to start

### Technical Investigation

**Root Cause Analysis:**

```python
# Original problematic payment processing
async def process_payment_webhook(webhook_data):
    # Synchronous processing causing bottlenecks
    booking = await get_booking(webhook_data.booking_id)

    if webhook_data.payment_status == "COMPLETED":
        # Heavy synchronous operations
        await update_booking_status(booking.id, "confirmed")
        await send_confirmation_email(booking.guest_email)  # 3-5 second operation
        await generate_smart_lock_codes(booking.property_id)  # 10-15 second operation
        await sync_to_platforms(booking)  # 20-30 second operation
        await prepare_guest_communications(booking)  # 5-10 second operation

    return {"status": "processed"}  # Total processing time: 38-65 seconds
```

**Performance Metrics During Peak Hours:**

- Webhook processing time: 45-65 seconds (PayPal timeout: 30 seconds)
- Payment confirmation success rate: 67%
- Guest communication delivery: 43% during peak hours
- Smart lock code generation: 52% success rate

**Traffic Analysis:**

- Weekend booking volume: 400% increase over weekdays
- PayPal webhook volume: 200+ per hour during peak
- Concurrent payment processing: 15-25 simultaneous requests
- Database connection pool exhaustion: 78% occurrence rate

### Resolution Implementation

**Solution 1: Asynchronous Payment Processing**

```python
# Improved asynchronous payment processing
from celery import Celery
import asyncio

app = Celery('payment_processor')

async def process_payment_webhook(webhook_data):
    """Quick webhook acknowledgment with async processing"""
    try:
        # Quick validation and acknowledgment
        is_valid = await validate_webhook_signature(webhook_data)
        if not is_valid:
            return {"status": "invalid_signature"}, 400

        # Update payment status immediately
        await update_payment_status(webhook_data.booking_id, webhook_data.payment_status)

        # Queue heavy operations asynchronously
        if webhook_data.payment_status == "COMPLETED":
            process_booking_confirmation.delay(webhook_data.booking_id)

        return {"status": "received"}, 200  # Quick response to PayPal

    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Webhook processing error: {e}")
        return {"status": "error"}, 500

@app.task(bind=True, max_retries=3)
def process_booking_confirmation(self, booking_id):
    """Asynchronous booking confirmation processing"""
    try:
        loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
        asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)

        # Run confirmation steps asynchronously
        tasks = [
            confirm_booking(booking_id),
            generate_access_codes(booking_id),
            sync_platforms(booking_id),
            send_guest_communications(booking_id)
        ]

        results = loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True))

        # Handle any failures
        for i, result in enumerate(results):
            if isinstance(result, Exception):
                logger.error(f"Task {i} failed for booking {booking_id}: {result}")

        loop.close()

    except Exception as exc:
        logger.error(f"Booking confirmation failed: {exc}")
        self.retry(countdown=60 * (self.request.retries + 1))
```

**Solution 2: Database Connection Pool Optimization**

```python
# Optimized database connection management
from sqlalchemy.pool import QueuePool
import asyncpg

# Connection pool configuration
DATABASE_POOL_CONFIG = {
    'min_size': 10,
    'max_size': 50,
    'max_queries': 50000,
    'max_inactive_connection_lifetime': 300,
    'command_timeout': 60
}

# Async connection pool
async def create_db_pool():
    return await asyncpg.create_pool(
        DATABASE_URL,
        **DATABASE_POOL_CONFIG
    )

# Connection context manager
@contextmanager
async def get_db_connection():
    async with db_pool.acquire() as connection:
        try:
            yield connection
        finally:
            pass  # Connection automatically returned to pool
```

**Solution 3: Webhook Retry and Recovery**

```python
# Webhook retry mechanism
