**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** July 9, 2025  
**Author:** Kevin Chen (Backend Lead)  
**Reviewers:** Rachel Martinez (Tech Lead), Emma Thompson (Security)

### Synchronization Process Overview

This document defines the complete booking synchronization flow for PropEase property management system across Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com, and direct bookings with PayPal payment processing.

### Synchronization Architecture

#### System Components

```
Booking Platforms â Webhook Receivers â Python FastAPI â Central Booking Engine
                                                    â
                                           Smart Home Controllers
                                                    â
                                            Guest Communication System
```

### Primary Synchronization Flows

#### Flow 1: New Booking Processing

**Actor:** External Booking Platform  
**Goal:** Process and synchronize new booking across all platforms

**Prerequisites:**

- Platform API integrations are active and authenticated
- Property calendar is initialized and synchronized
- Payment processing is configured via PayPal
- Guest communication templates are ready

**Main Synchronization Flow:**

1. **Booking Received:**

   - Webhook received from booking platform
   - Booking data validated and normalized
   - Duplicate booking check performed

2. **Calendar Updates:**

   - Central calendar immediately blocked for booked dates
   - All connected platforms updated with unavailable dates
   - Confirmation sent to originating platform

3. **Payment Processing:**

   ```python
   # PayPal payment processing
   async def process_booking_payment(booking_data):
       payment_request = {
           "intent": "CAPTURE",
           "purchase_units": [{
               "amount": {
                   "currency_code": "USD",
                   "value": str(booking_data.total_amount)
               },
               "description": f"Property booking {booking_data.confirmation_code}"
           }],
           "application_context": {
               "return_url": f"{BASE_URL}/booking/success",
               "cancel_url": f"{BASE_URL}/booking/cancel"
           }
       }
       return await paypal_client.create_payment(payment_request)
   ```

4. **Guest Communication Activation:**
   - Welcome message automatically sent
   - Check-in instructions scheduled
   - Smart home access codes generated
   - Property preparation workflow initiated

#### Flow 2: Booking Modification Synchronization

**Actor:** Guest or Property Manager  
**Goal:** Synchronize booking changes across all platforms

**Modification Types:**

- Date changes (check-in/checkout)
- Guest count adjustments
- Special requests or notes
- Cancellation processing

**Synchronization Flow:**

1. **Change Detection:**

   - Platform webhook indicates booking modification
   - Change type identified and validated
   - Impact assessment on other bookings

2. **Cross-Platform Updates:**

   ```python
   # Multi-platform synchronization
   async def sync_booking_modification(booking_id, changes):
       platforms = ['airbnb', 'vrbo', 'booking_com', 'direct']
       results = []

       for platform in platforms:
           if platform != changes.source_platform:
               result = await update_platform_booking(platform, booking_id, changes)
               results.append(result)

       return await consolidate_sync_results(results)
   ```

3. **Payment Adjustments:**
   - Price difference calculations
   - PayPal payment modifications or refunds
   - Security deposit adjustments
   - Fee recalculations

### Error Handling and Recovery

#### Synchronization Failure Scenarios

**1. Platform API Unavailable:**

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Fallback to manual synchronization queue
- Alert notifications to property managers
- Status dashboard updates for monitoring

**2. Conflicting Bookings:**

- Immediate blocking of affected dates
- Guest notification of potential conflicts
- Manual resolution workflow activation
- Compensation processing via PayPal

**3. Payment Processing Failures:**

- Booking hold while payment resolves
- Alternative payment method requests
- Automatic cancellation after 24-hour timeout
- Revenue impact tracking and reporting

#### Recovery Mechanisms

```python
# Booking conflict resolution
async def resolve_booking_conflict(conflicting_bookings):
    resolution_strategy = determine_resolution_strategy(conflicting_bookings)

    if resolution_strategy == "first_come_first_served":
        confirmed_booking = min(conflicting_bookings, key=lambda x: x.created_at)
        cancelled_bookings = [b for b in conflicting_bookings if b.id != confirmed_booking.id]

    for cancelled in cancelled_bookings:
        await process_cancellation(cancelled, reason="DOUBLE_BOOKING")
        await initiate_compensation(cancelled)

    return confirmed_booking
```

### Security Implementation

#### Data Protection

- **API Security:** OAuth 2.0 and API key rotation
- **Webhook Verification:** Signature validation for all platforms
- **Data Encryption:** AES-256 encryption for booking data at rest
- **Access Control:** Role-based access to booking information

#### Audit and Compliance

```python
# Booking synchronization audit log
async def log_sync_event(booking_id, platform, action, result):
    audit_entry = {
        "booking_id": booking_id,
        "platform": platform,
        "action": action,
        "result": result,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow(),
        "user_id": get_current_user_id()
    }

    await audit_logger.log_event(audit_entry)
```

### Integration Points

#### Smart Home Integration

```python
# Automated smart home setup
async def setup_smart_home_access(booking):
    access_code = generate_secure_access_code()

    smart_lock_config = {
        "property_id": booking.property_id,
        "guest_code": access_code,
        "valid_from": booking.check_in_date,
        "valid_until": booking.check_out_date,
        "guest_name": booking.guest_name
    }

    return await smart_home_manager.configure_guest_access(smart_lock_config)
```

#### Guest Communication Integration

### Testing Requirements

#### Integration Testing Scenarios

```python
# Test booking synchronization flow
async def test_booking_sync_flow():
    # Create test booking
    test_booking = create_test_booking()

    # Simulate platform webhook
    webhook_payload = generate_platform_webhook(test_booking)

    # Process booking
    result = await process_new_booking(webhook_payload)

    # Verify synchronization
    assert result.calendar_updated == True
    assert result.payment_processed == True
    assert result.guest_notified == True
    assert result.smart_home_configured == True
```
